# Third-Party APIs Challenge: 
*Work Day Scheduler*

This week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story
